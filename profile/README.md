### Building a More Open Financial System.
Paxeer was founded on the belief that decentralized technology can create a fairer, more accessible, and more efficient global economy. We are building the foundational infrastructure to make that a reality.

## Our Mission 
Web3 today is fragmented and complex. Our mission is to build a trustworthy crypto-trading platform that serves everyone, enabling healthy investments and increased profits through a superior user experience. We achieve this by reimagining the fundamental layers of user interaction, data provision, and smart contract wallet functionality from the ground up.
