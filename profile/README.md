## What is Paxeer?
Paxeer is not a traditional L1 or a single-purpose protocol. It is a capital orchestration network designed to implement a capital-to-user pipeline: a system where protocol-level balance sheet, risk, and execution are composed into a single substrate that continuously allocates on-chain resources to users, agents, and strategies.
